Hi! I'm Mason, a full-stack developer in San Luis Obispo, CA. I just graduated from [Cal Poly](https://www.calpoly.edu/) 📚, Computer Science class of 2022.

These days, I write code for [iFixit](https://github.com/ifixit), where we empower people around the world to fix their stuff.

Visit my [home site](https://masonmcelvain.com) for a portfolio of my recent work. Thanks for stopping by! 👋🏻
