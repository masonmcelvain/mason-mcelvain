Hi! I'm Mason, a lifelong learner, ocean & nature lover, and friend. I just graduated from [Cal Poly](https://www.calpoly.edu/) ðŸ“š, Computer Science class of 2022.

Feel free to check out my [home site](https://masonmcelvain.com) ðŸŒ´, a simple portfolio of my current projects.

I'm a software developer for [iFixit](https://github.com/ifixit) in SLO, where we empower people around the world to fix their own stuff. I got started in web development with [CSAI](https://www.calpolycsai.com/), the Cal Poly Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Club, where I helped build the club's chatbot, Nimbus.

My goals in life are to enjoy the present, know and be myself, and make the world a little better.
