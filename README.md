Hi! I'm Mason, a lifelong learner, ocean & nature lover, and friend. Right now I study Computer Science at [Cal Poly](https://www.calpoly.edu/) ðŸ“š, class of 2022.

Feel free to check out my [home site](https://masonmcelvain.dev/) ðŸŒ´, a simple portfolio of my current projects and passions. Big thanks to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for their deployment services ðŸŽ‰.

I'm a student software developer for [iFixit](https://github.com/ifixit) in SLO, where we empower people around the world to fix their own stuff. I'm also part of [CSAI](https://www.calpolycsai.com/), the Cal Poly Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence club, where I focus on web development for the club's chatbot, Nimbus.

My goals in life are to enjoy the present, put people first, be vulnerable, and make the world a little better.
