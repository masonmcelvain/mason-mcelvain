Hi! I'm Mason, a lifelong learner, ocean & nature lover, and friend. Right now I study Computer Science at [Cal Poly](https://www.calpoly.edu/) ðŸ“š, class of 2022.

Feel free to check out my [home site](https://masonmcelvain.dev/) ðŸŒ´, a simple portfolio of my current projects and passions.

Big thanks to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for their deployment services ðŸŽ‰.

My goals in life are to enjoy the present, put people first, be vulnerable, and make the world a little better.
