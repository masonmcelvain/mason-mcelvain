I've been building things with iFixit since November 2020. I started out as an
intern while still in school, and happily accepted a full time position when I
graduated.

<br />

I've grown a lot since I started, and I'm eternally grateful to my mentors.

-  [Sterling Hirsh](https://github.com/sterlinghirsh)
-  [Daniel Beardsley](https://github.com/danielbeardsley)
-  [Evan Naronha](https://github.com/evannoronha) (who I also credit for my love of rock climbing ü™®)

and many others.

<br />

At iFixit I mostly work in PHP, Next.js, and MySQL, with special appearances
from a few templating / configuration languages.

<br />

I've worked on a lot of things, but here are some of the highlights. Everything,
of course, is a team effort.

<br />

#### Migrating iFixit's ecommerce backend to Shopify

-  So many CSV scripts to import/export data
-  A plethora of webhook responders to keep our database in sync with Shopify

<br />

#### Rebuilding the [storefront](https://www.ifixit.com/Store) in Next.js

-  [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) for content management
-  [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/) for search
-  [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching
-  [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting

<br />

#### Plugging NetSuite's ERP into our ecommerce system

-  Active project, mostly building data pipelines

<br />
