I discovered computer science while researching enzymes in a biochemistry lab at Cal Poly.
Drowning in spreadsheets, a colleague suggested I visualize the data with Python.
All of a sudden, I found myself making all sorts of scripts to make my life in the lab a little easier.

<br />

After a few months of this, I knew I was in love.
I hung up the lab coat, changed majors, and joined the Cal Poly Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence club (CSAI).
I started building websites for students to interact with the club's chatbot, Nimbus, and soon I led a team that built a data cleaning app for Nimbus.

<br />

These days I work at iFixit, where I've gained an appreciation for what makes well organized software and delightful user experiences thanks to the mentorship of iFixit's senior developers and designers.
I've helped migrate iFixit's ecommerce experience to Shopify and reimplement their product catalogs with Next.js, Algolia's search engine, and Strapi's content management system.

<br />

I've learned that I really enjoy building beautiful web applications that help people achieve their goals, and I look forward to the challenges and learning opportunities that come with that.
