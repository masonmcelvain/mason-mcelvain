CSAI (Cal Poly Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence club) is where I
sunk my roots into web development.

<br />

I initially joined the club because I wanted to absorb as much as I could about
computer science as quickly as possible. I quickly realized that while the team
had A.I. developers in spades, they only had one web developer and their <Link href="https://csaicalpoly.com/" target="_blank" textDecoration="underline">website</Link>
was in rough shape. I volunteered to help out and was building websites on day
one.

<br />

With some patient guidance, I put some finishing touches on a chatbot interface,
then dove into building a private data cleaning UI for the team members from
scratch. My mentor and I whipped together a React + Webpack app, and it was love
at first site ❤️.

Soon I was leading the web development team for the summer. We pumped out a new
documentation site, a beautiful home page, and another chatbot interface by the
end of my year. When the Fall Career Fair came around at Cal Poly, I landed an
internship with iFixit and took the next step on my programming journey.
