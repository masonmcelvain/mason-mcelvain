[CSAI](https://csaicalpoly.com/) (Cal Poly's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence club) is where I first fell in love with web development.

<br />

As a recent computer science transfer, I figured that a club like CSAI had plenty of AI developers but might be short staffed on web developers, giving me an opportunity to take on large projects and hone my skills.
I was taken under the wing of a more experienced (ahem, the only) web developer at CSAI and started tackling frontend issues as I learned about CSS, Vue, React, and other frameworks the club was using.

<br />

Needless to say I was hooked, spending my weeknights and weekends hacking away with friends. Here are some of the projects we worked on:
