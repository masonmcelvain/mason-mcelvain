Hop is a browser extension that stores your top bookmarks in a visually pleasing
way. It's available on the [Google Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hop/djdlkcbfbdebfaoakhnoienanaakgccd)
and [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hop).

      <CaptionText>Hop's primary view on the left and edit mode on the right.</CaptionText>
   </CaptionedImage>

I was inspired to build Hop when I discovered an applet on Chrome that organized
links to a bunch of different Google apps. I thought it was a lovely interface, but
it had at least two problems:

-  It was only on the homepage.
-  I couldn't add new bookmarks to it.

   <CaptionedImage
      src={ChromeApplet}
      alt="The Chrome bookmark applet that inspired Hop."
   >
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <CaptionText>The Chrome bookmark applet that inspired Hop.</CaptionText>
   </CaptionedImage>
</Center>

<br />

I set out to make a browser extension that organized my apps in the same way _and_
had the additional features I wanted.

<br />

Just to get the app up and running, I had to learn how to use a bundler (first
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), then [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io)) to
transform my favorite web development tools (e.g. [React](https://react.dev),
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com))
to a file structure that Chrome's extension engine could understand.

<br />

My next challenge was to give the user the ability to sort the links via drag and
drop. I used a React library called [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about)
to create a grid of drop targets that each bookmark could be dragged into. I learned
about the subtle complexity of resorting items smoothly every time the user hovers
over a drop target with an item in drag.

<br />

When I ported the extension to Firefox, I ran into unexpected memory constraints
that forced me to restructure the app's memory model. Firefox exposes favicons as
1-2 kb SVGs and limits each item in local storage to 8 kb. Thus, a list of ~5 bookmarks
would exceed this limit, which would have been an unreasonable shortcoming for a
bookmark extension. So instead of storing a list of bookmark objects, I refactored
the app to store a list of bookmark object IDs and then store each bookmark object
as an independent item.

<br />

In the end, I produced a beautiful open-source extension with all the desired features,
and it now helps a handful of users and I navigate the web every day.
