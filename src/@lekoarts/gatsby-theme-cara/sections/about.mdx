## About

> I'm an outdoor enthusiast, truth seeker, and friend. I develop software at [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/)

This year I swam from [Anacapa to Oxnard](https://santabarbarachannelswim.org/anacapa-roadmap/) with my best buddy Colin, I summitted Mt. Whitney for the first time with my roommates, and ran the 4x4x48 challenge with my friends Ethan and Owen. These days I'm learning how to rock climb and exploring new places as much as I can.

I like computers because they present a lot of interesting problems that usually have logical answers. I also like how they can help humans connect and interact with the world in new ways. I don't like how they separate humans and disconnect us from our surroundings, so I try to avoid writing code that does that.
