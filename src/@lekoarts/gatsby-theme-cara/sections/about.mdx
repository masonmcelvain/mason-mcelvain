> Challenge. Pleasure. Knowledge. Peace.

Last year I swam from [Anacapa to Oxnard](https://santabarbarachannelswim.org/anacapa-roadmap/) with my best buddy Colin, I summitted Mt. Whitney for the first time with my roommates, and ran the 4x4x48 challenge with my friends Ethan and Owen. These days I'm learning how to rock climb and be an adult that's not in school anymore.

For work I write software at [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/). I like computers because they present a lot of interesting problems that usually have logical answers. They can also help humans connect and interact with the world in new ways. I don't like how they separate humans and disconnect us from our surroundings. I try to avoid writing code that does that.

I'm on a mission to align what brings me joy with the things I'm passionate about, like climate change and social equality. I strive to challenge my assumptions about the world, bring positivity and growth into the lives of those around me, and accept the things I cannot control.
