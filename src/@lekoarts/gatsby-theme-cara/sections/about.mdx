## About

> I'm an outdoor enthusiast, truth seeker, and friend. I develop software at [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/)

This year I swam from [Anacapa to Oxnard](https://santabarbarachannelswim.org/anacapa-roadmap/) with my best buddy Colin and I summitted Mt. Whitney for the first time with my roommates. These days I'm learning how to rock climb and training for my first marathon.

I like computers because they present a lot of interesting problems that usually have logical answers. I also like how they can help humans connect and interact with the world in new ways. I don't like how they separate humans and disconnect us from our surroundings, so I try to avoid writing code that does that.
